  <h3>3. How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3>
  Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill?
  Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?
  <br><br>
  Learning and understanding this skill will change my life as I will have control over what I need to do and be able to actually do it.
  <br>

  <br>
  <h3>4. How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,

  <br>
  They can enjoy life and will be in a much better position to help other people.
  <br>
  <h3>5. How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3>
  Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?
  <br><br>
  I will not fail. I will not waste this opportunity that GOD has given me to learn and acquire new skill that will take me to new boundaries and cross it with much imagination.
  <br>
  Failure will bring shame to my family.
  <br>
  <h3>6. What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h3>
  Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will
  you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?
  <br><br>
  If I get to accomplish my goal of understanding web development and learning the programming languages that makes applications work as they should, then I consider it a beginning of countless endeavors and projects that will help people beyond
  their understanding.
